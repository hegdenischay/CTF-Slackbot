 WIP Slackbot for c0d3_h4cki05.
 
 Inspired by [OTA's Slackbot](https://github.com/OpenToAllCTF/OTA-Challenge-Bot), and uses code from [email-to-slack](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/email-to-slack).
 
# Features

- Uses the CTFTime API to automate a bunch of tasks like checking for information about new CTFs, and reminding users about them.
- Uses the Reddit (praw) API to randomly select a meme (default sub is [r/dankmemes](https://old.reddit.com/r/dankmemes)) and post it in a channel
- Uses code from email-to-slack to send emails to a specific channel in Slack.
